Version 0.2.0
- to be used with the second edition of CWR (Springer)
- reunited with data sets from ChemometricsWithRData, which has become obsolete
- no longer on CRAN, to be installed from github

Version 0.1.13
- added scores to the list of imported (from pls) and exported
  functions so that the original behaviour was restored (thanks to
  Sergio Oller)
- fixed a bug in the efa function (thanks to Ambarish Nag)

Version 0.1.12
- removed ChemometricsWithRData as a dependency, the package is no
longer on CRAN but still accessible through github

Version 0.1.8
- updated maintainers' email address
- fixed NAMESPACE issues for packages MASS and pls
- added year to book citation

Version 0.1.7
- ChemometricsWithR no longer uses "Depends" for all
  packages that are mentioned in the book, but rather "Suggests" these
  other packages. This means that installation of ChemometricsWithR will
  not automatically imply installation of the others. Examples in the
  manual pages will now check the presence of the other packages and if
  a particular package is not found, an appropriate message will be
  printed to the screen. In addition, several datasets from other R
  packages have been included in the ChemometricsWithRData package so
  that unnecessary loading of packages (only for the data) is avoided.
- sd(matrix) has been replaced by apply(matrix, 2, sd) in the
  chapter3, chapter7 and chapter11 demos
